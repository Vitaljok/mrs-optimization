During the specification optimization research of multi-robot systems open source software packages have beed developed.
  * [CoMBot-Gen](CoMBotGen.md) - agent combination generation and analysis utility;
  * [GAMBot-Eva](GAMBotEva.md) - multi-robot system specification evaluation tool based on genetic algorithm;
  * [SiMBot-Ctr](SiMBotCtr.md) - control system framework for simulated multi-robot systems.
